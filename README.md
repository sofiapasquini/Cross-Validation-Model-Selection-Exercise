# Cross-Validation-Model-Selection-Exercise
Exploring cross-validation and model selection using data collected regarding features describing a set of soccer players.
I use a data set entitled "footballer_data.csv" in this exercise, in which "overall" is the target variable. I use Pipelines to construct various linear models which I evaluate using cross-validation scores.
